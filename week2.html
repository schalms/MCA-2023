  <p>I have tried with all my heart to edit 10 bars of Claire de Lune by Claude Debussy</p>
  <img src="ClairDeLuneUpgraded.pdf" alt="NClair de Lune Remastered">


    <p>The first issue that came with transposing Claire De Lune was the time signature was wrong. It read the 9 on 9/8 as 6l. It also hade issues when I would fix the timing or rhythm, it would push more issues into the next bar. By bar 10, it was a chaotic mess. I am still trying to understand the double voice but it would move that around too.</p>
