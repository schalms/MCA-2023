        <h2>Metadata</h2>
        <a href="NemosEggEDIT.mei">Metadata of Nemo Egg</a>
  
  <p>I added my copyright because I believe it is important to the integrity of the piece and the original artist. As for other MEI headers, I felt it was also important to add titleStmt information so I obviously did title and composer as they are essential to defining what has been created. Also adding <respStmt> to allow me to add my own information and show I had indeed edited this file.</p>


    <h2>Verovio</h2>

    <p>I always prefer my metadata to be formatted in normal phrases and not in run-on sentences. Perhaps using bullet points would help and create some semblance and readability. Right now it looks like a mash of information. Also, organising them by their Stmt locations such as titleStmt would help place relevant information together.</p>
