    <p>Listening back to the transposed Claire de Lune I made in week 2 versus what I made this week is interesting when it has been put through multiple audio transposers. It changed my time signature to 184 which is over double the speed of the original at 94. I feel that it also added notes or possibly moved my notes that played at the same time to after making it seem like there are more notes. It did not sound like my original piece, but now I feel this is how Studio Ghibli makes their music sound whimsical (this is no disrespect to Studio Ghibli, I am truly poor at transposing music but itâ€™s the vibe I got).</p>
