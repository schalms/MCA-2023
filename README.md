## Week 1
### Question 1
[p]I have chosen to look at Night on Bald Mountain composed by by Modest Mussorgsky in 1867. The audio is performed by Leopold Stokowski and The Philadelphia Orchestra, based on his production of it in Fantasia in 1940 with a length of 8:59 minutes.

### Question 2
[p] I think some of the challenges will be reading music. I have a very basic understanding of sheet music but not to the extent of classical music. I think also finding constant musical content can change through sheet music. Consistency can be a big issue. As it is presented, I am daunted by the Russian sheet music as I do not speak Russian but I will focus on the music. With all the audio versions of the suite that are out there, this seems pretty consistent in being about 7 to 9 minutes long, not adding too much to what is written.
