### Question 1
[p]I have chosen to look at Nemo's Egg by Thomas Newman. Its is a very short piece that consists of music and sound design for 1 minute and 17 seconds. It is the main theme from the 2003 animated feature Finding Nemo

### Question 2



[p] I think some of the challenges will be reading music. I have a very basic understanding of sheet music but not to the extent of fully comprehending it. It is also a very short piece but i feel i can evaluate it with depth and care.

## Week 2
Insert Claire de Lune

## Week 3
Think about: which attributes can be employed in each standard, which parents and children can be used, and try to think of the implications of these differences.

I believe that my data was really well documented in both MEI and Atom even including sticatto and a strong accent. Things that were invisible on musescore became visible on both Atom and MEI. It was interesting to play with the code in MEI, it was easier to have a visual aid to see my code and notes change.
In conclusion, MEI is neater but less user fiendly but more beneficial for more physical and viewing learners.
