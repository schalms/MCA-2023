## Week 1
### Question 1
[p]I have chosen to look at Nemo's Egg by Thomas Newman. Its is a very short piece that consists of music and sound design for 1 minute and 17 seconds. It is the main theme from the 2003 animated feature Finding Nemo

### Question 2



[p] I think some of the challenges will be reading music. I have a very basic understanding of sheet music but not to the extent of fully comprehending it. It is also a very short piece but i feel i can evaluate it with depth and care.
