        <h2>Question 1</h2>
  
  <p>I have chosen to look at Nemo Egg by Thomas Newman. It is a very short piece that consists of music and sound design for 1 minute and 17 seconds. It is the main theme from the 2003 animated feature Finding Nemo</p>

        <source src="nemoegg.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" style="width:400px;height:200px;">
    </audio>
    
    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <p>I think some of the challenges will be reading music. I have a very basic understanding of sheet music but not to the extent of fully comprehending it. It is also a very short piece but i feel i can evaluate it with depth and care.</p>
