        <h2>Question 1</h2>
  
  <p><b>Think about: which attributes can be employed in each standard, which parents and children can be used, and try to think of the implications of these differences.</b></p>

<p>I believe that my data was really well documented in both MEI and Atom even including sticatto and a strong accent. Things that were invisible on musescore became visible on both Atom and MEI. It was interesting to play with the code in MEI, it was easier to have a visual aid to see my code and notes change. In conclusion, MEI is neater but less user fiendly but more beneficial for more physical and viewing learners.</p>
